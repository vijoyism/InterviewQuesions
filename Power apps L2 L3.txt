Canvas Apps
1. What are the main components in the canvas app?
2. How do you improve the performance of the canvas app?
3. What is delegation in the canvas app?
4. In PowerApps, how do you define or use a local or global variable? - updateContext and set
5. Can you make the canvas apps more responsive?  - Containers
6. How do you submit the data from canvas apps? - Patch() and Submit()
7. Can you load data from external sources into the canvas app?
8. How you will make sure that your canvas app is ready for Offline use?
9. What is a DataCard in the form?
    -	Inside of the form, when you select a Field, that field is portrayed as a DataCard in the Tree view. Notice how each DataCard contains four different controls. The two most important controls in your DataCard are the label control, which will initially include the name DataCardKey, and the text input control, which will initially include the name DataCardValue. The other two controls are optional and depend on whether the data is required or not. The StarVisible is a text label with an asterisk in it that appears if you designate that field as required (either in your form or in the data). The ErrorMessage is another text label that appears if you try to submit a form and that input is missing. You can look at the Visible properties for these controls. Visible evaluates to: "true" or "false". The And() function you'll see in the StarVisible control means that both conditions, separated by a comma, must be true for the function to evaluate as "true".
10. What is the difference between UX(User experience) and UI(User Interface)?

11. How can Error Handling be implemented in Power Apps?
Ans: To do so, first, we will have to get information about any errors through the Errors function. And then, through Validation and DataSourceInfo, 
      some of the errors can be ignored even before they take place.
      The Canvas App introduced the 'IfError' and 'isError' functions, to manage errors and display the appropriate message.
      Formula-level error management must be enabled in order to use these features. To enable it, follow the steps below:
      
      •	To begin, start the Canvas App and choose File.
      •	Under Settings, select Advanced Settings.
      •	Allow for formula-level error management.
